## üìå Overview
MGRAD-UNet is an advanced neural network designed for medical image segmentation, addressing limitations in traditional UNet architectures such as pixel-level information loss and redundant feature fusion. By leveraging **multi-scale differential decoders** and a **gated reverse attention mechanism**, MGRAD-UNet enhances segmentation accuracy, particularly for small organs and boundary regions.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Multi-Scale Differential Decoder (MSD)**: Extracts complementary features at pixel and structural levels through differential operations between adjacent layers.
- **Gate-Control Reverse Attention (GRAD)**: Focuses on edge features and key regions using a gated feedback mechanism.
- **Dual-Decoder Structure**: Combines features from two differential decoders to improve robustness and accuracy.
- **Aggregated Loss**: Supervises multi-stage predictions by combining losses from non-empty subsets of feature maps.
